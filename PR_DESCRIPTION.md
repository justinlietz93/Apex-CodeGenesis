### Description

This PR implements several security enhancements to improve the overall security posture of the Apex CodeGenesis VSCode extension:

- Updated CODEOWNERS to reflect new ownership and responsibility for different parts of the codebase
- Added Python backend dependencies to dependabot.yml for automated daily security updates
- Pinned versions in requirements.txt for better dependency management and vulnerability tracking
- Updated package-lock.json and package.json to use the latest version of dompurify
- Integrated DOMPurify for sanitizing URLs in McpMarketplaceCard component to prevent XSS attacks
- Created SECURITY.md to outline the security policy and reporting process
- Added codeql-analysis.yml for automated security scanning
- Implemented check-cross-deps.js script to analyze cross-language dependencies and generate reports

### Test Procedure

- Verified that DOMPurify correctly sanitizes URLs in the McpMarketplaceCard component by ensuring malicious URLs (javascript: protocol, etc.) are properly sanitized
- Ran CodeQL analysis locally to ensure no new security issues were introduced
- Confirmed the check-cross-deps.js script correctly identifies and reports on dependencies across JavaScript and Python components
- Verified that Dependabot correctly identifies the Python dependencies for updates
